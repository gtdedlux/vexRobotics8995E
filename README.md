### 8995E — 2024–2025 & 2025–2026 Seasons

This repository contains projects from two seasons of VEX Robotics:

- **2024–2025 (HIGH STAKES)** — Two codebases: **Amster** and **LemTiger**
- **2025–2026 (PUSH BACK)** — One project (in progress)

---

## Season Breakdown

# **2024–2025 Season — HIGH STAKES**
During this season, our team worked on two programming frameworks and developed multiple autonomous routines.

### 🔵 Amster Project (EZ-Template)
The **Amster** project uses the **EZ-Template** library.  
It features reliable encoder-based navigation, PID controllers, and complete autonomous routines designed for consistency and quick development.

### 🟠 LemTiger Project (LemLib)
The **LemTiger** project uses **LemLib**, utilizing dead-wheel odometry to track the robot’s exact position on the field.  
This project was focused on precision movement and advanced navigation capabilities.

### 2024–2025 Season Demo Runs

# **2025–2026 Season — PUSH BACK**
This section contains our development for the **2025–2026 PUSH BACK** season.  
As the season progresses, robot code, autonomous routines, and documentation will be added here.
